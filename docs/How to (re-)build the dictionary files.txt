*****
THE EASIEST WAY:

The sorter, makedict, makestem, makeewds, and makeefil in this repository have been modified to accept command line options to automated the steps below.

sorter will take D, S, and E, which will sort dictline, stemlist, and ewdsfile, respectively

the other programs accept G (or S) to sort the GEN files

so you can distill all the following steps to these commands.  rebuild.sh in tools runs 'em for you:
1 75
./sorter D
./makedict G
./sorter S
./makestem G
./makeinfl
./makeewds G
./sorter E
./makeefil

SIMPLIFIED INSTRUCTIONS FOR MANUAL RE-BUILD:

Below is a simplified version of Wm. Whitaker's instructions for fully rebuilding the dictionary system.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  The "wakedict"-"makedict" distinction has been abandoned in this version
				 Always run makedict.


Run sorter against modified DICTLINE.GEN.  Input:
       SORTER
         DICTLINE.GEN    --  Input
            1 75         --  STEMS
           77 24   P     --  POFS + DECL/CONJ
          111 80         --
          101 1          --  AGE
          107 1          --  FREQ
          DICTLINE.GEN   --  OUTPUT

Copy DICTLINE.GEN to CHECK.IN and run CHECK.
Review CHECK.OUT.

Run MAKEDICT against DICTLINE.GEN

Run SORTER against the resulting STEMLIST.GEN
       SORTER
         STEMLIST.GEN    --  Input
           1    18   U
           20   24   P
           1    18   C
           1    56   A
           58    1
         STEMLIST.GEN    --  Output

DO NOT REMOVE WEIRD TO_BE AT THE FIRST LINE - IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE

Run makestem

Run MAKEINFL against INFLECTS.LAT

That completes the Latin->English dictionary prep.  To make the English->Latin dictionary:
Run MAKEEWDS against DICTLINE.GEN

Sort EWDSLIST.GEN
SORTER
    EWDSLIST.GEN
       1  24  A         --  Main word
       1  24  C         --  Main word for CAPS
      51   6  R         --  Part of Speech
      72   5  N   D     --  RANK
      58   1  A         --  FREQ
    EWDSLIST.GEN        --  Store

Run MAKEEFIL

=> Done.

THE FOLLOWING IS NOW THE FULL DATA SET:
WORDS [executable]
INFLECTS.SEC
ADDONS.LAT
UNIQUES.LAT
DICTFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
EWDSFILE.GEN
