Below is a simplified version of Wm. Whitaker's instructions for fully rebuilding the dictionary system


*****
EVEN EASIER:

The sorter, wakedict, makestem, makeewds, and makeefil in this repository have been modified to accept command line options to automated the steps below.

sorter will take D, S, and E, which will sort dictline, stemlist, and ewdsfile, respectively

the other programs accept G (or S) to sort the GEN files

so you can distill all the following steps to these commands.  rebuild.sh in tools runs 'em for you:

./sorter D
./wakedict G
./sorter S
./makestem G
./makeinfl
./makeewds G
./sorter E
./makeefil

Run sorter against modified DICTLINE.GEN.  Input:

            1 75         
           77 24   P     
          111 80        
          101 1        -- SPR:  TEST THIS Sort first by age
          107 1        -- SPR:  TEST THIS Then frequency 
          

Copy DICTLINE.GEN to CHECK.IN and run CHECK. 
Review CHECK.OUT.

Run WAKEDICT (note the W) against DICTFILE.GEN

Run SORTER against the resulting STEMLIST.GEN
       SORTER
         STEMLIST.GEN    --  Input  
           1    18   U
           20   24   P
           1    18   C
           1    56   A
           58    1         
         STEMLIST.GEN    --  Output  
         
DO NOT REMOVE WEIRD TO_BE AT THE FIRST LINE - IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE

Run makestem

Run MAKEINFL against INFLECTS.LAT


--English part:

Run MAKEEWDS against ewdslist.gen
	Check output, especially for weird lines at top.  Remove weird lines at top.

Sort EWDSLIST.GEN
SORTER
    EWDSLIST.GEN
       1  24  A         --  Main word
       1  24  C         --  Main word for CAPS
      51   6  R         --  Part of Speech  
      72   5  N   D     --  RANK
      58   1  A         --  FREQ
    EWDSLIST.GEN        --  Store 

Run MAKEEFIL

-- end English part

THE FOLLOWING IS NOW THE FULL DATA SET:
WORDS [executable]
INFLECTS.SEC
ADDONS.LAT
UNIQUES.LAT
DICTFILE.GEN
STEMFILE.GEN
INDXFILE.GEN
EWDSFILE.GEN
