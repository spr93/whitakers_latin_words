_Instructions for Old Compilers_

BACKGROUND

Gen. Whitaker wanted Words to compile and run anywhere.  He limited his code to standard, non-implementation-dependent Ada.  He mostly stuck to Ada 83, adding only one Ada 95-dependent feature (command-line parameters that relied on Ada 95 libraries).  He even distributed 286 DOS binaries as late as 2006.

We're proud to continue Whitaker's tradition of extraordinary portability.

SUMMARY

Words can be easily modified to compile in just about any validatable compiler provided that the built-in Integer, Direct_IO.Count, and Text_IO.Count types all use at least 32-bit integers.

INSTRUCTIONS

For Ada 2005 and 2012, just use the Unicode_Package in the "nonunicode" directory.

For Ada 95, you should also:
-  Give all Unicode-related subprograms null bodies; remove with's/use's from (non-)unicode.adb.
-   Remove Arabic2Roman.
-   Remove all references to Ada.Directories and Ada.Environment_Variables.
-- In sorter.adb, remove the Put_Line call in ECHO_ENTRY.

For Ada 83, you must make all the foregoing changes; remove all code that references Ada.Command_Line; and revert to older, more verbose syntax in a few places that your compiler will identify.
